      <h2>🎯 Why Your Patients Use This</h2>

      <p>Patients track their clusters here because it actually works during an attack. One massive button. Tap it. Done. They can add details later when they're not writhing in pain.</p>

      <p>No complex forms. No tiny buttons. No required fields they can't think about at 3am. Just fast, simple tracking that captures what matters.</p>

      <h2>📊 Data You Actually Need</h2>

      <p><strong>Every attack includes:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Precise start/end times with automatic duration calculation</li>
        <li>Pain intensity on standard 1-10 scale</li>
        <li>Medications taken and effectiveness</li>
        <li>Triggers and associated symptoms</li>
        <li>Side affected and pain location</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Reports show:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attack frequency patterns (daily/weekly/monthly)</li>
        <li>Cluster period identification and duration</li>
        <li>Circadian rhythm analysis</li>
        <li>Treatment response rates</li>
        <li>Complete medication history</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🔗 How Patients Share With You</h2>

      <p>During appointments, patients generate a secure share link. You click it. No login needed. You instantly see <strong>beautiful, professional reports</strong> featuring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comprehensive tables listing every attack with timestamps, duration, and intensity</li>
        <li>Visual charts showing attack patterns, frequency trends, and circadian rhythms</li>
        <li>Medication effectiveness graphs comparing treatments side-by-side</li>
        <li>Clean, organized data you can print directly or save as PDF</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Several patients have told me these reports helped get their oxygen approved. Insurance companies like professional documentation. Now your patients have it.</p>

      <h2>⚡ Zero Friction</h2>

      <p><strong>For patients:</strong> Sign up with just a username. No email. Start tracking immediately.</p>

      <p><strong>For you:</strong> Click their share link. View data. No account needed.</p>

      <p>That's it. No complex onboarding. No vendor relationships. No IT department involvement.</p>

      <h2>🔒 Privacy First</h2>

      <p>No emails collected. No tracking pixels. No ads. Data encrypted and stored in Germany. I built this for fellow sufferers, not to harvest data.</p>

      <p>Patients own their data. They can export everything as CSV anytime. When they share with you, it's temporary (30 days) and read-only.</p>

      <h2>📢 Tell Your Patients</h2>

      <p class="text-xl">Just say: <strong>"Track your clusters at clusterheadachetracker.com"</strong></p>

      <p>That's all. When they come back, they'll have real data instead of vague recollections.</p>
