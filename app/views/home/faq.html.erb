      <h2>üß† About Cluster Headaches</h2>

      <p><strong>What are cluster headaches?</strong><br>
      Imagine someone stabbing a hot poker through your eye socket for 15 minutes to 3 hours. They come in cycles, often at the exact same time each day. Some call them "suicide headaches" - once you've had one, you understand why.</p>

      <p><strong>How are they different from migraines?</strong><br>
      Migraines make you want to lie in a dark room. Clusters make you want to bang your head against a wall. They're shorter but way more intense. You can't lie still - you pace, rock, sometimes scream.</p>

      <p><strong>What causes them?</strong><br>
      Nobody really knows. Doctors talk about the hypothalamus and histamine, but here's what matters: they're not your fault. Not stress, not diet, not lifestyle. Just bad luck with brain chemistry.</p>

      <h2>üì± About This Tracker</h2>

      <p><strong>Why did you build this?</strong><br>
      I tried everything - paper diaries, spreadsheets, other apps. Nothing worked when I was in pain. So I built what I needed: something fast, simple, and actually useful for getting treatment approved.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I start tracking?</strong><br>
      Sign up with just a username (no email needed). Hit the big "Log Attack" button when one starts. That's it. Add details later when you're not dying.</p>

      <p><strong>What makes this different?</strong><br>
      Built by a sufferer, for sufferers. One-tap logging during attacks. Charts that show real patterns. Reports that get oxygen approved. No ads, no BS.</p>

      <h2>üîí Privacy & Security</h2>

      <p><strong>Is my data really private?</strong><br>
      Yes. No email required, no tracking pixels, no analytics. Data is encrypted and stored in Germany (strongest privacy laws). I built this for us, not to harvest data.</p>

      <p><strong>Why no email signup?</strong><br>
      Because when you're desperate at 3 AM, you don't need another password reset. Pick a username, start tracking. Lost password? Sorry, that's the price of real privacy.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I export my data?</strong><br>
      Yes. Download everything as CSV anytime. Your data is yours.</p>

      <h2>üéØ Using the Tracker</h2>

      <p><strong>Can I track during an attack?</strong><br>
      YES. Massive button. One tap. Done. Add details later when you're human. I designed this mid-cycle, so I know what's possible when you can't think.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I share with my doctor?</strong><br>
      Generate a secure 30-day share link that gives your doctor beautiful, professional reports. They'll see comprehensive tables of every attack, visual charts showing your patterns, and graphs comparing medication effectiveness. No login needed for them. Print the reports directly or save as PDF for your records. Multiple users got oxygen approved with these clean, professional reports instead of messy handwritten notes.</p>

      <p><strong>Does it work on my phone?</strong><br>
      Yes. iOS app, Android app, and web version. Everything syncs. Start on your phone during an attack, add notes on your computer later.</p>

      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Support & Development</h2>

      <p><strong>Is it really free?</strong><br>
      Yes. I pay for servers myself. There's a donate button if you want, but no pressure. This isn't a startup. It's a tool I needed, now we all have it.</p>

      <p><strong>Found a bug?</strong><br>
      Tell me on <a href="https://github.com/crmne/cluster_headache_tracker/issues" class="link">GitHub</a>. I fix things fast because I use this tool too.</p>

      <p><strong>Want a new feature?</strong><br>
      Ask on GitHub. If it helps track clusters better, I'll probably build it. Best features come from users who actually understand the pain.</p>
