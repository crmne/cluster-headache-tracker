    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-12 text-center">About Cluster Headaches</h2>

          <h3 class="card-title text-xl mb-4">What are cluster headaches?</h3>
          <p>Imagine someone stabbing a hot poker through your eye socket for 15 minutes to 3 hours. That's a cluster headache. They come in cycles (clusters), often at the exact same time each day. Some call them "suicide headaches" - and once you've had one, you understand why.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title text-xl mb-4">How are they different from migraines?</h3>
          <p>Migraines make you want to lie in a dark room. Clusters make you want to bang your head against a wall. They're shorter but way more intense. You can't lie still - you pace, rock, sometimes scream. And they're predictable as clockwork.</p>

        <div class="card-body">
          <h3 class="card-title text-xl mb-4">What causes them?</h3>
          <p>Nobody really knows. Doctors talk about the hypothalamus and histamine, but here's what matters: they're not your fault. Not stress, not diet, not lifestyle. Just bad luck with brain chemistry.</p>

<!-- Why I Built This -->

        <p class="text-xl text-center">I tried everything - paper diaries, spreadsheets, other apps. Nothing worked when I was in pain. So I built what I needed: something fast, simple, and actually useful for getting treatment approved.</p>

            <p>Sign up with just a username (no email needed). Hit the big "Log Attack" button when one starts. That's it. Add details later when you're not dying.</p>

          <p>Because when you're desperate at 3 AM, you don't need another password reset. Pick a username, start tracking. Lost password? Sorry, that's the price of real privacy.</p>
